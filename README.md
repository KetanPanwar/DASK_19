Analysis of FIFA 2019 data
We plan to compare the players using various fields. Our main concern is to help the club managers choose the best possible teams while not exceeding a general budget. We wish to cluster players using various fields such as preferred foot, position where he plays, age group, country, etc. Then we form such teams and see if any existing team as close formations. If such teams exist, we see their performance and measure the accuracy of our model.
